Marketing via mobile application has become common in recent times in consumer markets \parencite[cf.][]{Chaffey.2017}. Either using in app advertisement, or by giving a free trail when using the app. Regarding the increase in smart phone users, and the increased amount of time spend using hand held device, shows the potential of mobile marketing parencite[cf.][]{Chaffey.2017}. On the other hand, it is less common to use smart phones as a marketing channel, when talking about business to business (B2B) products, most often sold via a request for proposals.

IBM shifted from an hardware focused firm to a consulting, software and service company. But this shift is often not recognized at the global market. This turns into a problem, whenever IBM answers a business or software related call for proposal, because the possible customer may not believe, that a - in his or her perception - hardware company has the required skills for his or her problem \parencite[cf.][]{Sachs.20.04.2017}.

In means of designing a way, to show a potential customer the expertise of IBM, a team focused on migration scenarios in the banking sector, thought of a mobile application or a website as potential marketing instrument \parencite[cf.][]{Sachs.20.04.2017}. This paper will focus on the question, whether conclusions can be made from this application to the more general concept of B2B marketing apps. 
\paragraph{} After a review of the literature regarding this topic, a methodological setup will be described and tested on the given case. In a closing discussion, the attempt will be made to synthesize concepts to be taken into account when designing a B2B marketing app.
