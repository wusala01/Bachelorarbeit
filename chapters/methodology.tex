\chapter{Methodological Approach to Requirement Engineering}
\textcite[22-23]{Pohl.2007} explains, that applied requirements engineering always must be closely connected to the architectural planning of realization. This is because the architecture of a application induces insights, which can lead either to conflicts, or to gaps in the requirements set at the give state of work \parencites[22-23]{Pohl.2007}. 

\paragraph{} This reflects the iterative nature of requirements engineering as described on \cpageref{iterative}. Thereby each step but the first of the following procedure will end in a check for bidirectional implications of architecture and requirement. The reason for the first step not following a checkup is, that no requirements are formulated yet.

\paragraph{} For reasons of simplicity, this feedback loop will not be mentioned after each individual methodological step. The tools for architectural design of applications will described at the end of this chapter.


\section{Finding the Context Definition}
This thesis will start the requirement engineering as suggested by \textcite{Pohl.2007} and described in \Cref{ssec:reqEn} by gathering information from the requirement sources. For orientation this paper will orientate at the source categories shown in \Cref{fig:reqFlow} on \cpageref{fig:reqFlow} going top down. 

\paragraph{} In the first instance, personas (see below) will be produced, in order to gasp the stakeholders. Withdrawing from the personas and other sources of information - some provided by the sponsor -, goals will be derived into use cases (see below). Those use cases will be analyzed for implications on the facets of the system context, as described on \cpagerefrange{beginFacets}{endFacet}. 


\subsection{Using Diagrams}

\end{wrapfigure}
The system context diagram consists of four components: system, people, data flow, and domain boundaries \parencites[cf.][76-77]{Lauesen.2008}. Each one has its own representation, displayed in \Cref{fig:scdSym}. System context diagrams are used to identify required interfaces \parencites[cf.][75]{Lauesen.2008}, as well as to define the system boundary \parencites[cf.][75]{Ebert.2014}. It is an important overview of requirement sources, reflecting all interacting systems and persons. The direction of the arrow can show the direction of the data flow, or more commonly display the direction of intend \parencite[cf.][77]{Lauesen.2008}. In this paper the direction of an arrow will display the direction of intend.


\subsection{Using Personas}
Marketing communication applications have the quirk of having no direct impact of the targeted users on the product. They cannot directly be interviewed for goals and requirements. Additionally the group of targeted users is normaly to large to wrap your head around them. That is the reason for using personas. Human brains are caring more bout individuals, than large groups \parencite[cf.][]{Platt.2016}. Reasoning, archetypal individual people \parencite[cf.][81-82]{Cooper.2007}, which embody specific characteristics of groups \parencite[cf.][]{Platt.2016}. Identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing personas is a multistage procedure, which is always based on a type on research \parencite[cf.][39]{Robier.2016}. Research methods for this kind do not claim to scientifically acurate, but must not be based solely upon stereotypes and arbitrary decisions \parencite[cf.][82-83]{Cooper.2007}. 

\paragraph{} For identification of relevant stakeholders \textcite[38]{Robier.2016} suggest the usage of a stakeholder map (cf. \Cref{fig:stakeMap}). People of the left hand side of the vertical axis are the users of the program, divided into heavy users (far left) and fist time users (narrow to the axis) \parencite[cf.][38]{Robier.2016}. This approach aims not at the identification of each individual stakeholder, but at the identification of stakeholder groups to be represented by a persona \parencite[cf.][82]{Cooper.2007}, explicitly  including non-users \parencite[cf.][84]{Cooper.2007}.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{img/stakeholderMap.pdf}
    \caption[Stakeholder Map]{Stakeholder Map (own illustration based on \cite[38]{Robier.2016})}
    \label{fig:stakeMap}
\end{figure}
Analysis of the personas identified, includes the specification of a personas traits. Since personas are represented as individual people \parencite[cf.][81]{Cooper.2007}, it has all attributes a natural person has, including a name, gender, age, family, education, and most importantly: a motivation \parencites[cf.][]{Platt.2016}[cf.][83-84]{Cooper.2007}. All traits of a persona must be contributing to a bigger picture, and thereby must be intentionally be set to suggest intended characteristics \parencite[cf.]{Platt.2016}. 

\paragraph{} As an example: Our persona Kevin Smith (25, male) works at a international bank as foreign trade manager after his studies in financial management at Harvard Business School and needs a way to plan his meetings in accordance to required travel times. In his free time he has a private single engine plane. If you ask yourself whether Kevin needs his schedule in a standardized time zone, such as UTC, the answer will definitely be yes, because he is on the one hand used to using UTC at work and in his hobby. Martha Jones (55, female) works at a local retailer since her diploma from community college, now being store manager, requiring a tool to plan and distribute shifts of her employees. She on the other hand will have more use for local time. Both may be personas for a calendar service focused on business customers. 

\paragraph{} All traits of Kevin and Martha will have implications on the conception and development of the hypothetical calendar service. Beside the very different functionality requests of transport service provider integration, respectively shift planning and public calendar provisioning, the age may have implications on the devices used, as well as the education implies different kinds of prior knowledge. 

\paragraph{} The prioritization of personas heavily depends on the specific product. It may be done by expected revenue (e.g. for sold services), least specialization (e.g. for training software) or any other reasonable technique for prioritization.

    \caption[Template for Personas]{The template used for personas in this paper (own illustration)}
    \label{fig:persTemp}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{} The resulting personas are usually documented in a resume containing all relevant information \parencites[cf.][40]{Robier.2016}[cf.][]{Platt.2016}. This paper will use the template shown in \Cref{fig:persTemp}. It includes a picture of the persona, his or her personal information, his or her goals, needs, and for users his or her technological parameters.


\section{Main Activity}
\subsection{Sourcing Requirements from the Context}
The information of each facet will be compiled into goals for the desired outcome and which then will be clustered into the types of requirements described in \Cref{ssec:reqTypes} (cf. \Cref{fig:reqTypes} on \cpageref{fig:reqTypes}). The formulation of the goals will be done in a sentence stencil (see below) for requirement documentation. 

\paragraph{} The requirements will be itemized and clarified as much as possible to that point. They also will be

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Diagram Notation for Scenarios}
For the documentation of scenarios, two types of diagram are recommended by \textcite[299]{Pohl.2007}. On the one hand, the use case diagram, which displays the goals of actors when interacting with the system, and on the other hand, sequence diagrams, which display the chronological set of interactions included in one use case.

    \label{fig:ucSymb}
\end{wrapfigure}
As mentioned above, use case diagrams consist actors, use cases and the system. It display in what kind the actors are directly or indirectly linked to the use cases. Actors can be generalized aggregations of other actors. As an example: business traveler and tourists are both visitors of hotels. They have different goals when visiting the hotel, but share some as well. The use case diagram will display the individual goals with the distinct actors, but generalize them to the visitor actor, which connects to the common goals. This example can be seen in \Cref{fig:ucEx}. As seen in \Cref{fig:ucEx}, the goals do not have to be connected directly to the actor.

\section{User Interface Conception}


\subsection{Minimalist Approach of understandable User Interfaces}
Facing the challenges of \textit{Attention Economy}, business decision makers must explore applications at a higher speed that private users, because as stated above, spend attention implies costs of opportunity \parencite[cf.][]{Bakar.2017}. Therefore, designing a application must be done in optimization for fast knowledge transfer and easy exploration. In order to achieve this goal, \textcite{Bakar.2017} suggests a set of goals:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Getting Started Fast} implies, that no unnecessary contents are disturbing the user from using the core functionality of the page by drastically removing  \say{explanatory and procedural information and let the user learn [...] through exploration} \parencite{Bakar.2017}.
\item{Training on Real Tasks} leads the user more easily receiving information and being more restrained by the application, due to a sense of excitement.
\item{Reading in Any Order} means the quality of the individual information to be not to have perquisite knowledge of any other page within the application.
\item{Exploiting Prior Knowledge} can help to keep the users attention by mostly presenting new information. This is documented as being dificult to be implemented successfully \sekcite{Carroll.1987}{}{Farkas.1990}{}.
\item{Coordinating System and Training} represents the progress of novice users in learning to work with the software. This is accomplished by keeping the users attention on the user interface and supplying constructive information.
\item{Supporting Error Recognition and Recovery} implies strong testing of the application to determine necessary error recognition and implement sufficient information recovery.
\item{Using the Situation} suggest providing the user many ways to explore the application in means of functionality and informational contents. Offering options for preoccupying oneself with the application amplifies the information transfer but increases the potential for errors.
\item{Developing Optimal Training Design} pertains the correlation of the user interface design to the users needs and behaviours. 
\item{Reasoning and Improvising} relatives the approach of explorative interaction by offering instructions where compulsory.
